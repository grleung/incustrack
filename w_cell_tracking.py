# This is the second script to run. Here, we use tobac to connect features in time
# to form cell tracks then subset those tracks which do not go within 9.6km of domain edges
# and which last longer than 2 minutes

# inputs: tobac output dataframe of features (from w_feature_identification)
# output: tobac output dataframe of tracked cells

# To run this script, just do "python w_cell_tracking.py" in command line.

# For questions, contact Bee (gabrielle.leung@colostate.edu)
